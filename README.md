# Demo code for TASFAR
### Introduction 
In this repo, we demonstrate TASFAR by pedestrian dead reckoning (location sensing), as in one of the experiments in the original paper. In pedestrian dead reckoning, a model utilizes the inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals to estimate the 2D walking trajectory of phone users. In the experiment, we use MCNN as baseline model and show TASFAR can further improves its performance on each user.

This demo consists of two parts:
- Pseudo-label generation of TASFAR
- Training on pseudo-labels
- Testing on adapted models
